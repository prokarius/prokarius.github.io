<div>
  <p>I am a dedicated person with 4 years of programming experience, specialising in cryptography and cybersecurity. I enjoy learning as the knowledge and perspective it gives me improves my teaching skills and expands my world view. I regularly participate in hackathons and CTFs, and have received awards in them; I attribute this to my creativity, flexibility and adaptability to new situations. I believe my ability to learn new technologies and successfully implement them in a short period of time will contribute greatly to my undertaking of any challenges that I encounter.</p>

      <h3>Avid Traveller</h3>
      <br>
      <p>In today's developed world, most people live comfortable lives. We can relax and float where the currents take us, or actively paddle our way towards our passion.<p>
      <p>I view travelling as a way to broaden my perspective while getting myself out of my comfort zone. It not only opens my mind to various cultures, it also allows me to build friendships from all around the world. As much as I enjoy making friends and discussing with them, I would very much love to meet and talk to you!</p>

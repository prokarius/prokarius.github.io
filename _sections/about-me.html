<p>I am a dedicated person with 4 years of programming experience, specialising in
cryptography and cybersecurity. I enjoy learning as the knowledge and perspective it gives
me improves my teaching skills and expands my world view. I regularly participate in hackathons
and CTFs, and have received awards in them; I attribute this to my creativity, flexibility and
adaptability to new situations. I believe my ability to learn new technologies and successfully
implement them in a short period of time will contribute greatly to my undertaking of any
challenges that I encounter.</p>

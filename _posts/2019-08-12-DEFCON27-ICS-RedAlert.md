We won a DEFCON 27 CTF in the IoT village.

My team [CTF.SG](https://ctftime.org/team/77768) placed first in a DEFCON CTF. The theme of this CTF revolves around smart cities, and breaking the industrial systems that power these smart cities.

Challenges involve decoding and reverse engineering the Zigbee protocol, reversing and decoding RF signals to perform replay attacks, decoding DNP3 and Modhub protocol transmissions.

Unfortunately we did not win a black badge this year, but it was nevertheless an awesome experience to learn to break smart cities!

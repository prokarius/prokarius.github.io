Nutrialliance is all in one app to provide accessible healthcare for everyone.

Quoted from the Facebook event page:- The 2018 START UP Campus SDG Camp is a project to discover start-ups with innovative ideas and technologies contributing to the resolution of the common social problems and economic development in Asia in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs).

Doing research, we found that villagers from rural Philippines are not able to get timely and adequate healthcare, as the Community Healthcare Volunteers are not adequately prepared. Also, some of the hard copy records are also physically lost.

The product we pitched is an all in one smartphone application that allows Community Healthcare Volunteers to triage the patients in the rural villages. The villagers also would be able to download the application to learn about nutrition.

At the same time, the application would store the triaged data as electronic medical records, so that it is easy for the volunteers to pull up past data for a particular patient they work on. This would also allow doctors to quickly pull up the medical data of the patients, and speed up diagnosis times and increase accuracy.

Through this application, we hope to achieve the 3rd UN SDG of bringing good health and well being for all.

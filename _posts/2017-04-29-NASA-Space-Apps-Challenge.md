Migrantlyzer is a visualization of human migratory patterns and factors.

In this hackathon, we created a javascript dashboard application. This allowed visualisation of human migratory patterns, and attempted to correlate various push and pull factors that may affect migrations in humans.

Data was scraped from NASA Databases and various official census sources online. The data scraping, converting and cleaning of the data was done in python.

The repository can be viewed [here](https://github.com/eujing/migrantlyzer)

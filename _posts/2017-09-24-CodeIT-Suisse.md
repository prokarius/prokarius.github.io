We developed and deployed a PaaS webapp to solve various algorithmic challenges in Python.

CodeIT Suisse is an annual algorithmic competition held by Credit Suisse together with teams from Hong Kong.

This year, the algorithmic challenges included fractional knapsack, O(n) sorting implementations, string processing, flood fill, coordinate geometry, as well as an interactive API challenge. You may view the [original host website here](http://cis2017-coordinator-sg.herokuapp.com/).

Our team managed to climb the leaderboards and get third runner up for this competition, despite having a rough start. It took us a couple of hours just to set up the server config, and a few more to until we were able to submit our code.

You may find the link to our solution code [here](https://github.com/rrtheonlyone/Credit-Suisse-CodeSprint). All the solutions were implemented in python, and a Django server was deployed for the challenge.

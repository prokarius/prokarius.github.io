ACTIV8 is an Andriod app that uses Google maps APIs to generate exercise paths based on a user's route home.

Diabetes is a common issue for people in Singapore, and in 2017, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong mentioned that there will be a War on Diabetes. Various measures were taken to reduce the amount of sugar Singaporeans consume, and also to increase the exercise duration of people. However, these do not seem to be working effectively.

The task for this hackathon was therefor to create a solution that will spur Singaporeans to take action against an unhealthy lifestyle.

My solution was to develop an andriod app that uses Google maps APIs and a list of points on interest on the map to plot out an exercise walking route for the user back home. It will allow the user to alight one train station early, and take the user on a walk past various points of interest.

Also, these routes can be saved as part of a trail, which the user would be able to go on every day as part of a routine. This can be integrated into the current HealthPoints incentive system that is already in place in the official HPB app.

Furthermore, the idea was developed further beyond the hackathon. It was later integrated into the official HPB Healthy 365 app that is being used by Singaporeans.

Flying Fish is a lightweight amphibious drone to do maritime surveillance. A Javascript dashboard was also developed to present the data.

Overfishing and unsustainable practices threaten the extinction of marine species and throw off the ecological balance of the oceans. As well, agencies do not have large amounts of resources to spend on the monitoring and enforcement of maritime fishing regulations.

The task for this hackathon was therefor to create a solution that would allow maritime regulators to effectively enforce regulations, and therefore allow sustainable fishing to take place.

Our solution was to create a lightweight amphibious drone that allows maritime surveillance to be conducted. It would be lightweight and solar powered so as to float on the surface of the water. Data from the drones will be transmitted using a mesh P2P network and relayed back to a base station, where the dashboard app could then display.

My fellow MIT teammates has managed to work out the cost and the design for the drone, and they have managed to lower the cost of such a system to be comparable to sending out monitoring ships. This would also allow operators to monitor a larger area for ships.

Furthermore, a dashboard application was created in Javascript which allowed the monitoring of the drone's status.

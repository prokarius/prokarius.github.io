We designed an autonomous amphibious drone that can monitor and report illegal fishing in geofenced marine areas.

Overfishing and illegal fishing are pressing issues in today's world, and many governmental agencies do not have the time or money to patrol the open waters in order to curb fisherman from doing that.

Teaming up with 2 PhD students from MIT, we designed a light weight, fully autonomous drone solution to curb overfishing and illegal fishing in the ocean. The solution consists of an offline mesh network of drones that would be able to monitor a region of the ocean, and report back to a central command server of vessels doing illegal activities in the region.

The cost and design of the drones, while high, would be offset by the protection of our marine species in the world today. The lifespan of the drone are also estimated to be long enough that in the long run, these equipment would pay for itself in terms of the impact it would have on the marine ecosystem.
